# CodePath-Github

This is an iOS application leveraging the GitHub API to display repositories.

###Time spent: 10 hours

###Completed required user stories:
* [x] Add repoDescription to GithubRepo with data from API call
* [x] Add tableView in RepoResultsViewController
* [x] Designed custom cell to contain repository information
* [x] Cells contents are laid out using Auto Layout
* [x] Cell name and description labels wrap if text does not fit on one line.
* [x] Allow filtering by number of repository stars
* [x] Settings is modally presented
* [x] Minimum stars setting is represented with slider.
* [x] Settings Save button applies settings and queries API
* [x] Cancel button dismisses the Settings view and does not make API call
* [ ] Allow filtering by Language

###Completed optional user stories:
* [ ] Options for whether the search should match text in a repo's name, description, and/or README.
* [ ] Options for sorting search results based on stars, forks, or relevance
* [ ] Options for searching only repositories created after a certain date (e.g. within the past week, month, year).
* [ ]  Design and implement an interface for filtering based on all languages available on GitHub.

###Notes:
I was unable to complete the required filtering by Language. I had less time throughout the week to work on the lab and decided to prioritize the homework assignment.
I found it challenging to determine which cell had been selected and would like to come back to this last requirement when time permits.
